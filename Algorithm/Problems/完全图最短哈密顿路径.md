In a complete graph, assume there are n nodes(1,2,â€¦n), each permutation label represents a Hamiltonian cycle, but since the beginning point dosen't matter, there are same cycles among all those permutations.

Only consider those begin with node 1, there are (n-1)! permutations begin with 1, and half of them are same as another because they represents the same cycle tarveled in different directions.

Using branch & bound method, the problem is how to calculate each B&B tree node's cost

How about this:

At any time, the graph nodes could be seperated into two parts, the picked nodes and the remaining nodes, to calculate the last picked node's approximate cost, 

approximate cost = weights so far + (smallest edges between 1 and a remaining node) + (smalles edges between the current node and a remaining node) + the weight of the MST of the remaining node
