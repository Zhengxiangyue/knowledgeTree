### 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:

```
2, [[1,0]]
```

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

```
2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
```

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.



>  *有向图检测环，拓扑排序方法：*

1.每次删除图中**入度为0**的节点及其相关的边

2.重复1，直到图中没有入度为0的节点。如果图中还有节点，说明图中有环。
