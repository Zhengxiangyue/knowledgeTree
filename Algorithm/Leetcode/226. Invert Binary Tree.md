Invert a binary tree.

```
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
```

to

```
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```

>  Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

every time change root's left and right child, and invert both of its child separatly

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return nullptr;
        // every time change root's left and right child, and invert both of its child separatly
        
        TreeNode* temp = root->left;
        root->left = root->right;
        root->right = temp;
        invertTree(root->left);
        invertTree(root->right);
        
        return root;

    }
};
```
