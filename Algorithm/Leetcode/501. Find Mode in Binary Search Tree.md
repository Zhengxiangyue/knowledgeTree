### 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the [mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

-  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
-  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
-  Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

For example:
Given BST `[1,null,2,2]`,

```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2

```

return `[2]`.

**Note:** If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

给一个数据可能重复的 BST,即左子树的值小于等于根节点，右子树的值大于等于根节点，求出所有的众数。

思路：BST 的 in-order traverse 是 sorted

所以如果给你一个排序好的数组让你找出众数，O（1）空间扫两边就可以了，第一遍找出出现最多的次数，第二次把出现最多次数的数都加到结果数组里面
