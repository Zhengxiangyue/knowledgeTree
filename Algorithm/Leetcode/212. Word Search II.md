### 212. Word Search II

Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

For example,
Given **words** = `["oath","pea","eat","rain"]` and **board** =

```
[
  ['o','a','a','n'],
  ['e','t','a','e'],
  ['i','h','k','r'],
  ['i','f','l','v']
]
```

Return 

```
["eat","oath"]
```

.

**Note:**
You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.



思路和第一题有所不同，在矩阵的每一个字符开始搜索的时候，搜索的不是单个字符串

而是搜索一个前缀，比如 words 同时包含"oath"和"oaths"两个字母的时候，通过 trie tree 就可以再搜索一次的情况下同时查找前缀而不是单个字符串
