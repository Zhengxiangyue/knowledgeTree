Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

**Example:**
Given binary tree 

```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

```

Returns `[4, 5, 3], [2], [1]`.

**Explanation:**

\1. Removing the leaves `[4, 5, 3]` would result in this tree:

```
          1
         / 
        2          

```

\2. Now removing the leaf `[2]` would result in this tree:

```
          1          

```

\3. Now removing the leaf `[1]` would result in the empty tree:

```
          []         

```

Returns `[4, 5, 3], [2], [1]`.

思路：计算出每个节点的向下边数，也就是左右子树中向下边数较多的数量,向下边数为i 的节点将在第 i 次“剥壳”的时候被剔除

叶子节点的 downHeight = 0, 其他节点 = max(downHeight of right, downHeight of left) + 1
